            <p class="text-secondary">The coronavirus pandemic has brought the United States (and much of the world) to
              a halt. Restaurants have closed or are offering only takeout and delivery options,
              hotel business has slowed dramatically, and bars have been shuttered. As a result, people who rely on
              hourly wages (including those who rely on tips) are suffering, having seen their daily
              income all but disappear overnight, and for some already losing their jobs.Government relief efforts are
              helpful, and some businesses are continuing to pay their workers for an allotted period
              of time, but many have been left out in the cold. They need immediate relief to pay for food and other
              basic needs. To help them, Iâ€™m partnering with two organizations that have long been
              dedicated to helping those in need: Robin Hood in New York City, which has been providing stability to
              under-resourced communities across NYC for more than 30 years, and Tipping Point Community,
              a foundation that began in 2005 with the mission to break the cycle of poverty for people living in the
              San Francisco Bay Area. Tipping Point and Robin Hood have significant experience working
              with local community organizations that have expertise and experience distributing funds to the community
              members in need. Your donation will land directly in the pockets of hourly workers
              (including those who rely on tips) who have lost income or jobs. Direct financial grants will be provided
              to hourly workers for their immediate needs. Your donation is tax deductible to the
              extent permitted by law and 100% (less the standard transaction fee) of it will go directly to workers who
              need relief. (The operating budgets for Tipping Point Community and Robin Hood are
              underwritten by their respective boards of directors.) Your donation will go to GoFundMe.org and will be
              evenly distributed between Tipping Point Community and Robin Hood. Tipping Point Community
              and Robin Hood will distribute the donations to organizations that provide direct cash assistance to
              workers who are most directly affected.Initially, relief will support workers who are based
              We are working with GoFundMe.org (a 501c3 non-profit organization, EIN # 81-2279757, registered in the
              United States) to manage donations. All donations made on this page will be held by
              GoFundMe.org for the purpose of distributing such contributions to Tipping Point and Robin Hood in support
              of their efforts to aid those affected by COVID-19, subject to the variance power of
              GoFundMe.org, as stated in its policies. Donations are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. *By
              donating to this campaign, you agree to GoFundMe sharing your name and email with the
